KILL_WEB_SERVER_HELP = """Attack that crashes the web interface of RouterOS versions 6 > 6.49.10 - (CVE-2023-30800).

The web server used by MikroTik RouterOS version 6 is affected by a heap memory corruption issue.
A remote and unauthenticated attacker can corrupt the server's heap memory by sending a crafted HTTP request.
As a result, the web interface crashes and is immediately restarted.
The issue was fixed in RouterOS 6.49.10 stable.
RouterOS version 7 is not affected.

MikroTik RouterOS through 6.42 allows unauthenticated remote attackers to read arbitrary files and remote authenticated attackers to write arbitrary files due to a directory traversal vulnerability in the WinBox interface.
This makes it possible to read arbitrary password files in plain text.

- MAC Address
- IP Address

SNMP_HELP = """Get information via SNMP from devices with default community (public).

With this command it is possible to obtain various information from Mikrotik devices that have a vulnerable SNMP service.
As a target, you can pass an IP address, a network, or a grepable Nmap output file containing the IP addresses to search.

You can scan port 161 on a network with Nmap and save the discovered hosts to a file with the command:
[bold]sudo nmap -sU -p 161 --open -oG nmap-out.txt 192.168.88.1/24[/bold]

Using Nmap to find hosts with vulnerable ports and then passing the file with the IPs to MKX is more efficient than searching for information on all IPs on the network with mkx.
This way we will not try to search for information on addresses that do not have the SNMP port open.
